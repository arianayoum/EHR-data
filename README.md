In this project, I explored a CIHI dataset with hospital spending records from 2005-2022 by type of expense and by service area for Ontario and Canada.

The dataset can be found here: https://www.cihi.ca/en/hospital-spending

My objectives were: 
1) To analyze how Ontario allocates hospital spending relative to the national average.
2) To evaluate growth and volatility across Ontarioâ€™s hospital service areas to inform strategic investment decisions.
